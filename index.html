    <section id="about">
        <h2>About La Paz Zamboanga City</h2>
        <p>Barangay La Paz was once known as "Cadalagan" which may have been coined from the Tagalog word "dalag", a species of the freshwater fish caught in large numbers in the creeks and ponds in the area and the Cebuano word "dalagan" meaning “running” which refers to escaping prisoners from the San Ramon Penal Colony that normally pass through the Barangay in their futile dash to freedom.

            The place was once densely vegetated with hardwood species and was a booming and prosperous hub of large scale commercial logging in the 1950's up to mid-1990's. Dacon and Zamboanga Timber lorded over the forest resources and established Camp Susana in the upper portion of the Barangay as their base of operation. Commercial logging ceased in the late 1990's with the implementation of the selected logging and then recently the total log ban.
            
            The residents through the Sangguniang Barangay changed Cadalagan to La Paz to honor their patron saint La Virgen de La Paz. Cadalagan was retained as the name of a sitio in Lower La Paz.</p>
